                <p>My name is Nikhil Sharma and 
                    I am a front-end developer with experience in designing and implementing user interfaces for websites
                     and applications. I am skilled in using technologies
                      such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive
                       and interactive web pages. My goal is to provide the best possible user experience for the end-users 
                       and work closely with back-end developers and designers to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the client.
                        I am a dedicated and hardworking professional with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites and apps.</p>
